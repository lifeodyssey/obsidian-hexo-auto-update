## Implementation Order & Dependencies

### Critical Path:
1. **Foundation Layer** (DIContainer, Config, Events) - Days 1-5
2. **Core Services** (FileWatcher, ContentProcessor, GitOps) - Days 6-10
3. **Integration Layer** (Plugin Main, Migration) - Days 11-15
4. **Documentation & Deployment** - Days 16-20

### Parallel Work Opportunities:
- **Days 6-10**: Error handling can be developed alongside file watching
- **Days 11-15**: Unit tests can be written while integration work happens
- **Days 16-20**: Documentation can start while performance testing continues

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **RxJS Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple observables, add complexity gradually
   - Fallback: Implement simpler event-based system if needed

2. **File System Watching Performance**
   - Mitigation: Implement efficient filtering and debouncing
   - Monitoring: Add performance metrics early

3. **Migration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Maintain backwards compatibility throughout
   - Testing: Extensive integration testing with existing data

### Project Risks:
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict adherence to defined interfaces
   - Review: Daily progress reviews against plan

2. **Integration Issues**
   - Mitigation: Incremental integration with testing
   - Rollback: Maintain ability to revert to previous version
