# Obsidian-Hexo Integration Plugin
The Obsidian-Hexo Integration plugin allows you to monitor changes in your Obsidian vault, specifically the _posts folder, and automatically commit and push them to your Hexo blog repository.

## Features
Monitors changes in the _posts directory of your Obsidian vault.
Automatically commits and pushes changes to your Hexo blog repository.
Uses a symlink to link your Obsidian vault to your Hexo source directory, maintaining a separation of your notes and your blog posts.
## Installation
Download the latest release from the GitHub repository.
Extract the obsidian-hexo-integration folder from the zip to your vault's plugins folder: <vault>/.obsidian/plugins/
Note: On some operating systems it will be a hidden folder.
Reload Obsidian
If the plugin is installed correctly, you will have a new Obsidian Hexo Integration option in the settings tab.
Usage
After you have installed the plugin, go to the settings and specify the Hexo blog source path. The plugin will monitor the changes in the _posts directory and automatically commit and push the changes to your blog repository.
